It analyzes the 2016 survey results by OSMI.\nA few key data points:\n\nThere is an available target market of 2.8 million potential customers for BetterHelp.\nAnonymity around mental health in tech remains unknown for 65% of workers. Only 28% of them claim to have their confidentiality protected.\nOnly 26.8% of tech workers know their mental healthcare options available.\n51% of participants declared having a mental health disorder in the past. There is a statistically significant association between family history and personal history (p-value &lt; 0-05).\n80.2% of respondents chose “maybe” or “yes, it would” when asked if being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt their career.\n\nBetterHelp should address potential business partners with three defining features: anonymous, practical, and public-health-oriented."

Description of data\nThis data set was collected by Open Sourcing Mental Health, a non-profit dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities. The data set for 2016 contains over 1,400 self-reported responses from participants primarily in the United States.\nAlthough the survey was anonymous and confidential, with clear and neutral language, it is unclear how potential self-reporting bias issues were prevented. These limitations could be reduced in the future by applying response options randomization, ensuring reverse-coding, and cross-validating with other data sources."

However, I do not run it in this document to prevent the extensive variable list from being displayed.\n\n\n6.3. Data cleaning and formatting\nFrom skimming my data, I notice that I must proceed with the following data wrangling steps: * Filter out responses outside of the business task scope (from self-employed folks) * Rename column names * Remove outliers by age * Reformat gender responses * Reformatting mixed job titles * Renaming remote work categories\nFirst, we drop the variables containing responses from self-employed folks since the business task does not include them.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  select(-17:-24)\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  filter(`Are you self-employed?` != 1)\n\nThen, I rename all remaining columns. To achieve that, I load a rename mapping from a ´.csv´ file with old and new names. After, I use the ´rename()´ function.\n\nrename_mapping &lt;- read.csv(\"capstone_final_renaming.csv\")\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~rename_mapping$new_name, all_of(rename_mapping$old_name))\n\nThird, I remove outliers by age. The ´summary()´ function below shows 5 entries for unreasonable ages such as 3 or 323 years old - probably due to typos. Since we cannot contact participants, I proceed to drop these values outside working ages (18-80 years old), as they represent a small percentage of the total sample size (0.3%).\n\nsummary(clean_mh_2016$age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The ´skim_without_charts()´ function in section 6 shows that gender is currently formatted as strings with a lack of standardized formatting. So, I download all distinct genders as a .csv file, standardize naming, load a rename mapping, and replace the old gender column with a new one called gender_new.\n\ndistinct_genders &lt;- unique(clean_mh_2016$gender)\nprinted_genders &lt;- data.frame(Distinct_Gender_Values = capture.output(print(distinct_genders)))\nwrite.csv(printed_genders, file = \"gender_mapping.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nrename_mapping_gender &lt;- read.csv(\"gender_rename_mapping.csv\")\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  left_join(rename_mapping_gender, by = c(\"gender\" = \"old_names\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(gender_new = new_names) %&gt;%\n  select(-gender, -new_names)\n\nNow it is time to reformat mixed job titles. After listing all distinct job titles in the current data frame, I see a list of 264 distinct strings containing overlapping job titles concatenated by a pipe symbol. I proceed to split all job titles and recount them.\n\njob_categories &lt;- unlist(strsplit(clean_mh_2016$job_title, \"\\\\|\"))\njob_category_counts &lt;- table(job_categories)\n\nFinally, I rename current remote work responses for easier understanding in upcoming analysis.\n\nremote_work_count &lt;- table(clean_mh_2016$remote_work)\nprint(remote_work_count)\n\n\n   Always     Never Sometimes \n      217       318       611 \n\n\n\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n rename(work_modality = remote_work) %&gt;%\n mutate(work_modality = recode(work_modality,\n                              \"Always\"    = \"remote\",\n                              \"Never\"     = \"in-person\",\n                              \"Sometimes\" = \"hybrid\"))\nwork_modality_count &lt;- table(clean_mh_2016$work_modality)\nprint(work_modality_count)\n\n\n   hybrid in-person    remote \n      611       318       217"

    "text": "7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nIn this section I visualize and analyze the data set to understand participants’ characteristics before analyzing their survey responses. I begin by using the ´summary()´ function to check the central tendency and dispersion of the only numeric variable: age.\n\n# to summarize age\nsummary(clean_mh_2016$age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Half of all respondents range between 28 and 38 years old, which is a reasonable reflection of the general working population.\nThen, I explore the distribution of categorical variables like work_modality, gender_new, job_title, and country_work using the ´ggplot()´ or ´table()´ functions.\n\n# to plot company size distribution\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ncompany_size_levels &lt;- c(\"1-5\", \"6-25\", \"26-100\", \"100-500\", \"500-1000\", \"More than 1000\")\nclean_mh_2016$company_size &lt;- factor(clean_mh_2016$company_size, levels = company_size_levels)\n\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = company_size)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Company Size Distribution\", x = \"Company Size\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = paste0(sprintf(\"%.1f\", after_stat(count / sum(count) * 100)), \"%\")),\n    stat = \"count\",\n    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n– Almost half of the survey respondents belong to either a small-medium enterprise or a large corporation, as they account for 25.5% and 22.3% of the sample size respectively. The insights extracted from this analysis will better reflect these company sizes.\n\n# to plot work modality distribution\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = work_modality)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Work Modality Distribution\", x = \"Work Modality\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = paste0(sprintf(\"%.1f\", after_stat((count / sum(count)) * 100)), \"%\")),\n    stat = \"count\",\n    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n– Similarly, this analysis will better represent workers in a hybrid work model as they account for 53.3% of responses.\n\n# to plot gender distribution\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = gender_new)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Gender Distribution\", x = \"Gender\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5)) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = paste0(sprintf(\"%.1f\", after_stat((count / sum(count)) * 100)), \"%\")),\n    stat = \"count\",\n    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n– Almost 3 out of 4 respondents are male, which might be due to a lack of gender representation in the tech industry.\n\n# to plot job title distribution\nggplot(data.frame(Job_Category = names(job_category_counts), Count = as.numeric(job_category_counts)),\n       aes(x = Count, y = Job_Category)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Job Title Distribution\", x = \"Count\", y = \"Job Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = Count),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.8),\n    size = 3,\n    hjust = -0.2\n  )\n\n\n\n\n– The top two job titles refer to developers (back-end and front-end).

These would be the best territories for BetterHelp to expand their corporate partnership model as there is currently more information from that region.\nLastly, I create a mosaic plot for the work modality and gender categories to visualize the distribution of both categorical variables.\n\n# to create a mosaic plot\nmosaicplot(table(clean_mh_2016$gender_new, clean_mh_2016$work_modality), main=\"Mosaic for Gender vs. Work Modality\")\n\n\n\n\n– As a final note, this mosaic summarizes that most respondents are males working in the hybrid work model."

    "text": "8. Deep Data Analysis\nTo answer the three questions for analysis, I split up the survey results thematically as stated below: 1. Current mental health offer at tech companies: Info on mental health resources available + observed responses at work 2. Status of employees’ mental health at tech companies: Info on personal and family mental health history 3. Most recurrent attitudes towards mental health in the tech work space: Info on perceptions of mental health at work + perceptions of mental health on professional career\n\n8.1 Current mental health offer\nMental health resources available at tech companies\n\n# to check mh package coverage\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = \"\", fill = mh_package_offering, label = mh_package_offering)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))),\n            stat = \"count\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Does your employer provide mental health \nbenefits as part of healthcare coverage?\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..count..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(count)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n– Less than half of the sample population of tech workers claim to receive mental health benefits as part of their healthcare coverage. According to Statista, in 2020 the US employed roughly 5.2 million workers.

The point at which both of the previous answers differ is around the themes of “affect interview” (for physical health) and “stigma” (for mental health). This confirms previous hypotheses in this analysis.\n\n# to plot effect of MH self-identification on career\ncategory_order &lt;- c(\"Yes, it has\", \"Yes, I think it would\", \"Maybe\", \"No, I don't think it would\", \"No, it has not\")\ntotal_responses &lt;- nrow(clean_mh_2016)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = factor(mh_identity_effect_career, levels = category_order))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=sprintf(\"%0.1f%%\", after_stat(count / total_responses * 100))), vjust=-0.5, size = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"Response\", y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Do you feel that being identified as \na person with a mental health issue would\nhurt your career?\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n– When it comes to the broader perception of career, respondents lean towards believing that a mental health issue would “maybe” or “yes, it would” affect their tech career. This highlights that the perceived negative effects of mental health issues transcend the work place - so it becomes a public health issue too.\n\n# to plot effect of MH self-identification on coworkers' negative perception\ncategory_order &lt;- c(\"Yes, they do\", \"Yes, I think they would\", \"Maybe\", \"No, I don't think they would\", \"No, they do not\")\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = factor(mh_negative_perception_coworkers, levels = category_order))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(x = \"Response\", y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Do you think that team members/co-workers \nwould view you more negatively if they knew\nyou suffered from a mental health issue?\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n– Finally, there is mainly uncertainty around the effects of coworkers being aware of mental health issues, as there is an even distribution between existing or non-existing negative perceptions."

However, I do not run it in this document to prevent the extensive variable list from being displayed.\n\n\n6.3. Data cleaning and formatting\nFrom skimming my data, I notice that I must proceed with the following data wrangling steps: * Filter out responses outside of the business task scope (from self-employed folks) * Rename column names * Remove outliers by age * Reformat gender responses * Reformatting mixed job titles * Renaming remote work categories\nFirst, we drop the variables containing responses from self-employed folks since the business task does not include them.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  select(-17:-24)\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  filter(`Are you self-employed?` != 1)\n\nThen, I rename all remaining columns. To achieve that, I load a rename mapping from a ´.csv´ file with old and new names. After, I use the ´rename()´ function.\n\nrename_mapping &lt;- read.csv(\"capstone_final_renaming.csv\")\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~rename_mapping$new_name, all_of(rename_mapping$old_name))\n\nThird, I remove outliers by age. The ´summary()´ function below shows 5 entries for unreasonable ages such as 3 or 323 years old - probably due to typos. Since we cannot contact participants, I proceed to drop these values outside working ages (18-80 years old), as they represent a small percentage of the total sample size (0.3%).\n\nsummary(clean_mh_2016$age)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

The ´skim_without_charts()´ function in section 6 shows that gender is currently formatted as strings with a lack of standardized formatting. So, I download all distinct genders as a .csv file, standardize naming, load a rename mapping, and replace the old gender column with a new one called gender_new.\n\ndistinct_genders &lt;- unique(clean_mh_2016$gender)\nprinted_genders &lt;- data.frame(Distinct_Gender_Values = capture.output(print(distinct_genders)))\nwrite.csv(printed_genders, file = \"gender_mapping.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nrename_mapping_gender &lt;- read.csv(\"gender_rename_mapping.csv\")\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n  left_join(rename_mapping_gender, by = c(\"gender\" = \"old_names\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(gender_new = new_names) %&gt;%\n  select(-gender, -new_names)\n\nNow it is time to reformat mixed job titles. After listing all distinct job titles in the current data frame, I see a list of 264 distinct strings containing overlapping job titles concatenated by a pipe symbol. I proceed to split all job titles and recount them.\n\njob_categories &lt;- unlist(strsplit(clean_mh_2016$job_title, \"\\\\|\"))\njob_category_counts &lt;- table(job_categories)\n\nFinally, I rename current remote work responses for easier understanding in upcoming analysis.\n\nremote_work_count &lt;- table(clean_mh_2016$remote_work)\nprint(remote_work_count)\n\n\n   Always     Never Sometimes \n      217       318       611 \n\n\n\nclean_mh_2016 &lt;- clean_mh_2016 %&gt;%\n rename(work_modality = remote_work) %&gt;%\n mutate(work_modality = recode(work_modality,\n                              \"Always\"    = \"remote\",\n                              \"Never\"     = \"in-person\",\n                              \"Sometimes\" = \"hybrid\"))\nwork_modality_count &lt;- table(clean_mh_2016$work_modality)\nprint(work_modality_count)\n\n\n   hybrid in-person    remote \n      611       318       217"

Half of all respondents range between 28 and 38 years old, which is a reasonable reflection of the general working population.\nThen, I explore the distribution of categorical variables like work_modality, gender_new, job_title, and country_work using the ´ggplot()´ or ´table()´ functions.\n\n# to plot company size distribution\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ncompany_size_levels &lt;- c(\"1-5\", \"6-25\", \"26-100\", \"100-500\", \"500-1000\", \"More than 1000\")\nclean_mh_2016$company_size &lt;- factor(clean_mh_2016$company_size, levels = company_size_levels)\n\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = company_size)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Company Size Distribution\", x = \"Company Size\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = paste0(sprintf(\"%.1f\", after_stat(count / sum(count) * 100)), \"%\")),\n    stat = \"count\",\n    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n    size = 3\n  )\n\n\n\n\n– Almost half of the survey respondents belong to either a small-medium enterprise or a large corporation, as they account for 25.5% and 22.3% of the sample size respectively.

Further marketing initiatives should consider their needs to customize mental health offers.\n\n# to list respondents' countries in descending order\ncountry_counts &lt;- as.data.frame(table(clean_mh_2016$country_work))\ncountry_counts &lt;- country_counts %&gt;% arrange(desc(Freq))\ntotal_count &lt;- sum(country_counts$Freq)\ncountry_counts &lt;- mutate(country_counts, Percentage = Freq / total_count * 100)\nprint(country_counts)\n\n                       Var1 Freq  Percentage\n1  United States of America  716 62.47818499\n2            United Kingdom  133 11.60558464\n3                    Canada   61  5.32286213\n4                   Germany   44  3.83944154\n5               Netherlands   31  2.70506108\n6                 Australia   26  2.26876091\n7                    Sweden   15  1.30890052\n8                    France   11  0.95986038\n9                   Ireland   10  0.87260035\n10                   Brazil    9  0.78534031\n11                   Russia    9  0.78534031\n12                    India    7  0.61082024\n13                 Bulgaria    6  0.52356021\n14              New Zealand    6  0.52356021\n15              Switzerland    6  0.52356021\n16                  Denmark    5  0.43630017\n17                  Finland    5  0.43630017\n18             South Africa    4  0.34904014\n19                  Belgium    3  0.26178010\n20                    Chile    3  0.26178010\n21                    Italy    3  0.26178010\n22                   Norway    3  0.26178010\n23   Bosnia and Herzegovina    2  0.17452007\n24                 Colombia    2  0.17452007\n25                  Estonia    2  0.17452007\n26                   Israel    2  0.17452007\n27                   Mexico    2  0.17452007\n28                 Pakistan    2  0.17452007\n29                   Poland    2  0.17452007\n30                    Spain    2  0.17452007\n31              Afghanistan    1  0.08726003\n32                Argentina    1  0.08726003\n33                  Austria    1  0.08726003\n34               Bangladesh    1  0.08726003\n35           Czech Republic    1  0.08726003\n36                  Ecuador    1  0.08726003\n37                  Hungary    1  0.08726003\n38                     Iran    1  0.08726003\n39                    Japan    1  0.08726003\n40                    Other    1  0.08726003\n41                  Romania    1  0.08726003\n42                 Slovakia    1  0.08726003\n43     United Arab Emirates    1  0.08726003\n44                  Vietnam    1  0.08726003\n\n\n– The USA and Canada reflect 73% of respondents’ country of work. These would be the best territories for BetterHelp to expand their corporate partnership model as there is currently more information from that region.\nLastly, I create a mosaic plot for the work modality and gender categories to visualize the distribution of both categorical variables.\n\n# to create a mosaic plot\nmosaicplot(table(clean_mh_2016$gender_new, clean_mh_2016$work_modality), main=\"Mosaic for Gender vs. Work Modality\")\n\n\n\n\n– As a final note, this mosaic summarizes that most respondents are males working in the hybrid work model."

    "title": "Mental Health in Tech: R Analysis for BetterHelp",
    "section": "8. Deep Data Analysis",
    "text": "8. Deep Data Analysis\nTo answer the three questions for analysis, I split up the survey results thematically as stated below: 1. Current mental health offer at tech companies: Info on mental health resources available + observed responses at work 2. Status of employees’ mental health at tech companies: Info on personal and family mental health history 3. Most recurrent attitudes towards mental health in the tech work space: Info on perceptions of mental health at work + perceptions of mental health on professional career\n\n8.1 Current mental health offer\nMental health resources available at tech companies\n\n# to check mh package coverage\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = \"\", fill = mh_package_offering, label = mh_package_offering)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))),\n            stat = \"count\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Does your employer provide mental health \nbenefits as part of healthcare coverage?\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\nWarning: The dot-dot notation (`..count..`) was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `after_stat(count)` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n– Less than half of the sample population of tech workers claim to receive mental health benefits as part of their healthcare coverage. According to Statista, in 2020 the US employed roughly 5.2 million workers. For BetterHelp, this means that there is likely an available market of 2.8 million workers to expand their services to.\n\n# to to check for package knowledge\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = \"\", fill = mh_package_knowledge, label = mh_package_knowledge)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))),\n            stat = \"count\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Do you know the options for mental health \ncare available under your employer-provided coverage?\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n\n\n\n– Even though 46.3% of tech workers claim to have mental healthcare covered, only 26.8% know their care options available. This means there is a need for mental health coverage to be simplified to workers.\n\n# to check for mh discussion with employer\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = \"\", fill = mh_discussion_employer, label = mh_discussion_employer)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))),\n            stat = \"count\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Has your employer ever formally discussed mental\nhealth (for example, as part of a wellness campaign \nor other official communication)?\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n\n\n\n– Only 1 in 5 workers have discussed mental health with their employers, meaning that this is a topic not commonly addressed in the work space.\n\n# to check if employer offers mh resources\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = \"\", fill = mh_employer_resources, label = mh_employer_resources)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))),\n            stat = \"count\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Does your employer offer resources to learn more \nabout mental health concerns and options for \nseeking help?\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n\n\n\n– Moreover, only 1 in 4 workers claim their employer offers resources to learn more about mental health. This is coherent with the percentage of workers who claim to receive mental health coverage as part of their health care package.\n\n#to check for anonymity in the work place\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = \"\", fill = mh_anonymity, label = mh_anonymity)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))),\n            stat = \"count\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +\n  labs(title = \"Is your anonymity protected if you choose to take \nadvantage of mental health or substance abuse \ntreatment resources provided by your employer?\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n\n\n\n– Anonymity around mental health in tech remains unknown for most workers (65%). Only 28% of them claim to have their confidentiality protected, which might inform responses in section 7.3. around most recurrent attitudes. This means that BetterHelp needs to address transparency around anonymity in their marketing efforts.\nObserved responses at work\n\n# to check for past poor experiences at work\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = \"\", fill = mh_poor_response, label = mh_poor_response)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))),\n            stat = \"count\", position = position_stack(vjust = 0.3)) +\n  labs(title = \"Have you observed or experienced an unsupportive \nor badly handled response to a mental health issue \nin your current or previous workplace?\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL))\n\n\n\n\n– Only 16.8% of respondents have witnessed an unsupportive response to a mental health issue at work. However, this might be due to mental health not being addressed at work at all, rather than employers handling mental health issues properly. More research on that question would be needed.\n\n\n8.2 Status of employees’ mental health\nPersonal and family mental health history\n\n# to check for family history of mh\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = factor(mh_family_history, levels = rev(levels(factor(mh_family_history)))))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"#A1D99B\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Family History of Mental Health Issues\", \n       x = \"Family History\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n– Almost half of respondents claim to have a family history of mental health issues (47%).\n\n#to check for past mental health disorders\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = factor(mh_personal_history, levels = rev(levels(factor(mh_personal_history)))))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"#A1D99B\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Past Mental Health Disorder\", \n       x = \"Past MH Disorder\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n– While half of them also claim to have had a mental health disorder in the past (51%).\nI create a contingency table and perform a chi’s square test to check if family history and personal history are associated or independent categorical variables.\n\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(clean_mh_2016$mh_family_history, clean_mh_2016$mh_personal_history)\nprint(contingency_table)\n\n              \n               Maybe  No Yes\n  I don't know    59  60  95\n  No              49 242 100\n  Yes             76  77 388\n\n\nIn this case, the null Hypothesis (H0) is that the two variables are independent (there is no association).\n\ncontingency_table &lt;- table(clean_mh_2016$mh_family_history, clean_mh_2016$mh_personal_history)\nchi_square_test &lt;- chisq.test(contingency_table)\nprint(chi_square_test)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  contingency_table\nX-squared = 277.12, df = 4, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\n– Since the p-value is reported as less than 2.2e-16, much below the 0.05 level, I conclude that there is a statistically significant association between family history and personal history within my sample.\n\n# to check for current mh disorders\nggplot(clean_mh_2016, aes(x = factor(mh_current_condition, levels = rev(levels(factor(mh_current_condition)))))) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"#A1D99B\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"count\", aes(label = scales::percent(..count.. / sum(..count..))), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Current Mental Health Disorder\", \n       x = \"Current MH Disorder\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n– When inquired about current mental health disorders, there is a 24% decline in confirmed cases compared to past disorders (39% vs. 51%).
